# üöÄ AWS Serverless Order Processing System

## üìñ Application Overview

The **AWS Serverless Order Processing System** is designed to process orders end-to-end using a modern serverless architecture. It ensures scalability, efficiency, and security by leveraging AWS services like **API Gateway**, **Lambda**, **Step Functions**, **DynamoDB**, **S3**, and **SNS**. Below is a detailed explanation of the entire application process, from user interaction to the final receipt generation.

---

## üéØ Key Features

1. **Serverless Framework**:
   - Fully managed architecture using AWS cloud-native services.
2. **End-to-End Order Processing**:
   - Handles order validation, storage, payment processing, inventory updates, and customer notifications.
3. **Receipt Generation**:
   - Automatically generates a PDF receipt for every order.
4. **Email Notifications**:
   - Sends a confirmation email with the order receipt to the customer.

## üõ†Ô∏è End-to-End Application Workflow

### **1. User Interaction**
- **Frontend**:
  - The user accesses the frontend hosted on **Amazon S3**, which serves a React-based user interface.
  - Users fill out the form with:
    - **Product ID**: The identifier for the product they want to order.
    - **Quantity**: Number of units.
    - **Customer Email**: Email address to receive notifications.
  - Upon clicking "Place Order," the frontend sends the request to an **API Gateway** endpoint.

---

### **2. API Gateway**
- **Endpoint**: `/place-order`
- **Functionality**:
  - Acts as the entry point for the system.
  - Secures the API with authentication and authorization.
  - Routes the incoming request to the **Lambda Function** for order placement.

---

### **3. Lambda Function: Order Placement**
- Validates the incoming request data for completeness and correctness.
- Invokes the **AWS Step Function** to orchestrate the order processing workflow.

---

### **4. Step Functions: Workflow Orchestration**
The **AWS Step Function** coordinates the following steps sequentially:

#### **a. Validate Order**
- A Lambda function verifies:
  - The product exists in the **Inventory Table** (DynamoDB).
  - The requested quantity is available.
- If validation fails, the process halts, and an error is returned.

#### **b. Save Order**
- Another Lambda function stores the order details in the **Order Table** (DynamoDB).

#### **c. Process Payment**
- Simulates payment processing (can integrate with payment gateways like Stripe or PayPal).
- If the payment fails, the order is marked as failed.

#### **d. Update Inventory**
- Updates the stock in the **Inventory Table** to reflect the deducted quantity.

#### **e. Send Notification**
- Publishes an event to **Amazon SNS**, notifying the system that an order has been placed.

#### **f. Generate Receipt**
- A Lambda function generates a PDF receipt using the **FPDF library** and stores it in an **S3 bucket**.

---

### **5. DynamoDB**
Two tables are used:
- **Inventory Table**:
  - Tracks product stock levels.
- **Order Table**:
  - Records order details, including customer information, order status, and payment status.

---

### **6. Amazon S3**
- Stores generated PDF receipts securely.
- Configured with appropriate bucket policies to enforce HTTPS and restrict public access.

---

### **7. Amazon SNS**
- Sends notifications to downstream systems or subscribed endpoints (e.g., email or SMS) when an order is placed.

---

### **8. Email Notification**
- A Lambda function triggered by the workflow sends an email to the customer using **Amazon SES**.
- The email includes:
  - Order confirmation details.
  - A link to download the receipt from S3 or an attached PDF.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security and Monitoring

### **Security**
- **IAM Roles**: Fine-grained permissions for Lambda, Step Functions, and S3.
- **Bucket Policies**: Enforce secure access to S3 buckets.
- **API Gateway**: Secures endpoints with AWS IAM or Amazon Cognito.

### **Monitoring**
- **AWS X-Ray**:
  - Tracks end-to-end execution of the order workflow.
  - Identifies cold starts, latency, and potential bottlenecks.
- **CloudWatch Logs**:
  - Captures detailed logs for debugging.
- **CloudWatch Metrics**:
  - Monitors Lambda execution times, error rates, and invocations.

## üñ•Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### **Frontend**:
- **Framework**: React
- **Hosting**: Amazon S3

### **Backend**:
1. **API Gateway**: Entry point for the application.
2. **Lambda Functions**:
   - Modular functions for handling each step of the order processing.
3. **DynamoDB**:
   - Inventory Table for stock management.
   - Order Table for order records.
4. **Step Functions**:
   - Orchestrates the end-to-end workflow.

### **Storage**:
- **Amazon S3**: Stores generated receipts.

### **Messaging**:
- **Amazon SNS**: Sends notifications about order events.

### **Infrastructure as Code**:
- Managed using **CloudFormation** and **Terraform**.
