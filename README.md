Project Use Case: Real-Time Order Processing System

Architecture Overview:

User Interface (UI): A React frontend hosted on S3 and served via CloudFront.

Backend: API Gateway, AWS Lambda functions, Step Functions for order processing orchestration, and DynamoDB as the database.

Additional Services: SNS for notifications, S3 for storing receipts, and CloudWatch for monitoring.

Key Requirements:

Real-time Order Submission: Users can place orders through the e-commerce frontend.

Order Validation: Validate the order, including checking stock availability and payment verification.

Inventory Management: Deduct inventory once the order is placed.

Payment Processing: Integrate with third-party payment gateways.

Notification: Notify users via email when the order is successfully processed.

Store Order Receipts: Store the order details and generate a receipt to be stored in S3.

Monitoring: Use CloudWatch to monitor the flow, errors, and execution times.

Step-by-Step Implementation:

1. Frontend (React + API Gateway):

Create a React application for order submission.

Host the React frontend in S3 with CloudFront for faster access.

The frontend sends an API request to the API Gateway to submit the order.

API Gateway triggers a Lambda function to start the process.

2. API Gateway Setup:

Configure AWS API Gateway to expose a REST API with a /place-order endpoint.

This API will trigger an AWS Lambda function (OrderPlacementFunction).

The Lambda function will initiate an AWS Step Functions workflow.

3. AWS Step Functions:

Define a Step Function to manage the order processing workflow.

The workflow consists of multiple states:

Validate Order: Check for stock availability using Lambda.

Process Payment: Trigger payment processing using a Lambda function.

Update Inventory: Once payment is successful, deduct the inventory.

Send Notification: Send a confirmation email via SNS.

Generate Receipt: Store the order receipt in S3 using Lambda.

4. Order Validation Lambda:

Create a Lambda function (ValidateOrderFunction) that validates the stock availability by querying DynamoDB.

If the item is in stock, the workflow proceeds to payment processing.

5. Payment Processing Lambda:

Lambda function (ProcessPaymentFunction) integrates with a third-party payment service (e.g., Stripe).

After successful payment, update the payment status in DynamoDB.

6. Update Inventory Lambda:

Lambda function (UpdateInventoryFunction) updates the inventory in DynamoDB once the payment is processed.

If inventory update fails, trigger a rollback or handle errors via a defined Step Functions fail state.

7. Send Notification (SNS):

Create an SNS topic to send a notification to the user about the order status.

Lambda function (SendNotificationFunction) triggers SNS to send an email with the order details to the user.

8. Generate and Store Receipt (S3):

Lambda function (GenerateReceiptFunction) generates a receipt for the order and stores it in an S3 bucket.

A presigned URL is generated for users to download the receipt.

9. Monitoring and Error Handling:

Use AWS CloudWatch to track the workflow and log errors.

Step Functions should have proper error handling with retry logic or defined failure states.

CloudWatch metrics and alarms can be set to monitor for errors in the order process.


Architecture Overview:

Frontend (React): A simple order form hosted in an S3 bucket.

API Gateway: To handle order submission requests.

Lambda: Multiple Lambda functions for each stage of the order processing.

Step Functions: Orchestration for the order processing workflow.

DynamoDB: For storing orders and inventory data.

SQS: Queue to process background tasks like sending notifications and generating receipts.

SNS: For real-time notifications to users.

S3: For storing order receipts.

CloudWatch: For monitoring and error logging.
